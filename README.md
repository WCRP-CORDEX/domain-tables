# CORDEX domain tables

Grid information of CORDEX domains in machine readable format. Note that the domain identifier changes from CMIP5 to CMIP6: The global attribute that defines the domain
in CMIP5 is named `CORDEX_domain` where the domain resolution is indicated in degrees, e.g., `EUR-11` means Europe on a 0.11Â° resolution. The global attribute in CMIP6 is named
more precisely as `domain_id` which indicates the domain resolution roughly in km, which means that `EUR-11` becomes `EUR-12`! See also https://github.com/WCRP-CORDEX/cordex-cmip6-cv/issues/2 

## Tables

These tables define CORDEX domains in different coordinate reference systems (CRS) to allow all kinds of downscaling models to participate in CORDEX activities. Please note that the coordinates in the `rotated_grids` and `regular_grids` tables denote the *cell centers* while the coordinates in the `domain_boundaries` table define actual *boundaries* and no cell centers.

* `CORDEX-CMIP5_rotated_grids.csv`: Domain definitions in the rotated pole CRS (`rotated_latitude_longitude`).
* `CORDEX-CMIP5_regular_grids.csv`: Domain definitions in a regular latitude longitude CRS (`EPSG:4326`).
* `CORDEX-CMIP6_domain_boundaries.csv`: Domain boundaries in a regular latitude longitude CRS (`EPSG:4326`).
